## Key Workflows

1. User Registration - Collect user details - Save them in the database via Sanity CMS

2. Product Browsing - Fetch and display products - Real-time search and filter capabilities

3. Order Placement - Capture user orders - Validate data - Store them in Sanity CMS

4. Shipment Tracking - Integrate third-party APIs - Real-time tracking updates
